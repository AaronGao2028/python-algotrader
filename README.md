In the era of swift technological progress, an increasing number of companies are embracing trading algorithms and technical indicators to guide their decisions, veering away from reliance of conventional newspapers.

Python AlgoTrader analyzes historical stock data and uses the intersection of moving averages to determine the entry and exit of a position. A table of dates and an accompanying chart are generated, presenting both the date and corresponding entry or exit prices.
