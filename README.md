On August 28, 2024 Nvidia released their third-quarter earnings. Their revenue had topped an all time high of $32.5 billion beating average analyst expectations of $31.9 billion by 1.88%. By September 6, 2024 the stock had fallen 20.36% wiping out over $600 billion of market value within a span of a week, the largest drop of an individual stock in U.S. stock market hsitory.

So why did a stock that outperformed its historical earnings and beat the lofty expectations from analysts fall to such levels?
